	<h4> Justifications of design elements</h4>
<p><b>Font:</b>   Impact/RalewayBalmy<br><br>We utilized the sans-serif typeface impact because we felt as though the font did as the name suggests. We wanted our brand to exemplify boldness and uprightness, the font itself is literally bold and thicker in width, that is why we settled on that font. Our brand is one that encourages customers to be bold and courageous and therefore we decided to use <i>impact</i>. <br><br>
	The font <i>raleway</i> was used because we wanted to find a font that offset the boldness of impact. We settled on <i>raleway</i> because it was more gentle and soft but still provided some balance to the overall structure of the website. Alongside being bold, as a brand, we wanted to come as gentle as well, to portray a more honest and humble side to our brand identity. We believed that the <i>raleway</i> helped us achieve a more streamlined look. <br><br>
    Finally, we used the font that makes up our brand name, it's seen on our logo, website and all over our social media. We decided to use the font <i>balmy</i> because it is akin to someone using a thick marker and drawing on a board. We believed this font was youthful, a bit unruly and did a good job of immediately identifying itself as a brand that is for a more younger target market.</p>
<p><b>Colours</b>: #000000 #FFFFFF #92FB59 <br> <br>
	<u>#0000000- Black</u> <br>We used a black because it's often seen as a bold and rebellious color which we wanted our customers to identify with. According to color psychology “Black is a popular color in retail. In color psychology, black’s color meaning is symbolic of mystery, power, elegance, and sophistication.”(cite) As a brand we identify with the idea of power and elegance and have used quite a lot of black in our color scheme. 
	<br><br><u>#FFFFFF-White</u><br>
According to color psychology white is “showcases innocence, goodness, cleanliness, and humility.”(cite) These were traits we wanted to stand out about our brand as well. As justification, we decided it balanced well against the black and green that we utilized and gave it a more appeal. 
	<br><br><u>#92FB59- Lighter Green</u><br>
We used a lighter green for a few different reasons. The first reason was because we wanted the smile that replaced the “o” in WORN to stand out amongst the other letters in terms of color. Another reason we decided to make the smiley face light green was because in terms of color psychology “green is highly connected to nature and money. Growth, fertility, health, and generosity are some of the positive color meanings for the color.”(cite) Because our brand subtly has to do with nature as well as generosity in terms of our proposed business practices, a light green was the perfect colour that we had to incorporate in our website and logo.

<p><b>Interface patterns</b>
<br>
The structure of the navigation and content (how content is distributed across pages)
We wanted to create an easy and seamless shopping experience for our customers. Inspired by many clothing websites, the website itself is simple to navigate. Users can easily navigate by using the toolbar at the top which clearly lists all of the information and products. But also on other index’s, clarity is provided by the use of a navbar. Especially on pages with a lot of text, we want the visitor to get to specific pieces of information quickly. <br><br>Throughout the whole website, we used a lot of links to make interacting easier for our customers. On the website, a visitor can very easy check in on our socials as well as all the information you need. From where we source our products from, and what factory in Portugal labour is practiced, we wanted to provide full clarity to our customer. At last, that is what our brand is all about.

	<h4>Testings report</h4>
	<p><b>Testing goals</b><br>The goal for our paper prototype testing was to see how seamlessly our customers could navigate our website with limited error.
    <br><br><b>Testing Methods</b><br>In doing so, we invited participants to navigate our website using our paper prototypes. They tapped through and we were able to see how easily they were able to perform certain tasks and actions. 
	<br><br><b>Testing Results</b><br>Through our testing we discovered that the overall website was fairly easy to navigate and we proceeded with making the overall foundation of our website based on a paper prototype. The only thing we added was a shopping cart, because the tester were confused where they could pay for our hoodie.
