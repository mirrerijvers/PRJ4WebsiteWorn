  <p><ul>- <u>Reach objective:</u><br>We want to reach 70 followers for our instagram account and tiktok account combined.</ul><ul>- <u>Affect objective:</u><br>
	  We want our target audience to appreciate our cares and values as a company, and everything we do for it: honesty, diversity and sustainability. (We can measure this by posting statements and look if our followers agree by the amount of likes we get on certain posts/statements). </ul><ul>- <u>Response objective:</u><br>The intention to buy our hoodies. Interact with our social media campaign! We want to reach a minimum of 10 likes, and 2 comments on each one of our Instagram posts. In addition, we want 100 views and 5 comments on each one of our Tik Tok posts. We want an eventual amount of 20 users to have visited our website via the link we put in our bio’s on our social media platforms.</ul>To meet these stated objectives, we are conducting a promotional campaign through Instagram and TikTok. We did this by, among others, not focussing on eco-friendliness, but only taking it into account. We focus on our most important values; honesty and transparency. We thought about three categories; about WORN, quotes and the product. This is the overall line we wanted to follow. The posts are placed alternately so that a pattern can be seen.</p> <p><b>Instagram posts</b><br>About WORN:<br> Bringing out our vision, mission and values to make followers aware. Sharing an Introduction post, everything we stand for and our honest clothing label.<br><br>Quotes: <br>Bringing our values in a fun way, followers can interact with it, share them or comment on them. “70% recycled, 100% honest” - “Wear our hoodies and break taboos” - “honesty is something you can’t wear out” <br><br>Product:<br>We let the followers see what we sell and raise interest to buy our hoodies. Share three different color hoodies and let the followers see they are unisex.</p><p><b>Instagram stories</b><br>About WORN:<br>Sharing our vision, mission and price breakdown. Also create a poll where they can ask questions and vote for the next color hoodie. <br><br>TikTok:<br> Share TikTok video’s. Let the followers know that we also have a TikTok account that they can follow. <br>Inspiration:<br> Show in a fun way how people can style our hoodies, showing we are unisex and we are for everyone to wear. Also include a Kingsday., <br><br><b>TikTok</b><br> Introducing WORN:<br> A mysterious skate video with our logo showed up soon. To make the viewers aware there is something coming. <br><br>About WORN:<br> Making a video where we highlight our values. In this way viewers know what we are about.<br><br> Factory: <br>A video about our factory, where we highlight our workers and let the viewers see how our progress goes.<br><br>We post two Instagram posts, three Instagram stories and one TikTok video in the week. This does not spam our followers, but keeps them triggered and interested. To connect TikTok, Instagram and our website, we use links in the bio’s. We post our TikToks on our Instagram stories and in that way it’s all connected. </p>
  <h4 id="scrollspyHeading2">Learning points</h4>
  <p>In the process of developing our brand, we learned how to distinguish ourselves from the rest of the market. We did this by, among others, not focussing on eco-friendliness, but only taking it into account. We realized that steps that may seem small, like maintaining an Instagram account as well as a TikTok account, are a lot more work than we initially expected.<br><br>In such a small time, we were also a bit too optimistic about our marketing objective. We guessed too high in the number of followers we expected to get. Although setting high goals isn't bad, being realistic is definitely an advantage when it comes to having a better idea of what next steps need to take place. When it comes to our planning, we started a bit late because of the paperwork and interviews that needed to be done, we still wanted to post everything that we had planned. Therefore in the last week we posted a bit too much and that showed in the results.<br><br>Our results are:
On average we have 7 likes on our Instagram posts and on our stories we have an average of 18 viewers. We thought that it was easier to get more viewers on stories and from that they want to follow our page, but that wasn’t always the case. When we did something interactive in a story, for example a poll or a question, we got more interaction. When we go to the statistics of Instagram posts we see that the hashtags also work to get non followers to see our post and that is what we want. For the next time we could start looking more in hashtags that work for more followers. We didn’t expect to get DM’s (direct messages), but we got five accounts that wanted to collaborate or were interested in our brand.<br><br>We have far underestimated TikTok. It seems easy to get a lot of views, but that's not the case. The highest number of viewers is 117, we have 5 followers in total and 10 likes. We also underestimated the content creation because it's just videos. Next time we would like to be more original in this and also film "real" people. Next time we need to focus more on the interactive parts of social media and work with that.
</p>
  <h4 id="scrollspyHeading3">Future planning</h4>
  <p>The context behind the campaign was that we wanted our social media to appeal to our target audience, which were young adults between the ages of 16-27. In doing so, we decided the overall aesthetic of our brand should be mature, but still incorporate a fun and bold nature. Due to the fact that our clothing is overall very bright and colorful, we wanted background colors to be a bit darker to make our clothing stand out to someone scrolling through their phone because of the high contrast. A few learning points would be that it was fairly difficult to gain traction on our social media. A way we can manage this is by reaching out to people more directly and following more social media accounts. Another way to gain more of a following in the future would be to partner with other apparel companies and agree to share each other's brands on social media, a “shout out for shout out” per se. In order to boost each other's engagement and follower count. <br><br>In regards to the marketing plan, we would need to add more platforms to make ourselves stand out amongst other clothing brands and put forth a large amount of our budget to marketing as well. In addition, growing our social media would be one of our top priorities, as currently we don't have as much. Working with other brands and influencers would help greatly in our pursuit to grow our business, the same goes for including giveaways. We already put our website link in our Instagram bio, but in the future we want to use the option to shop our hoodies via Instagram.<br><br>Overall, we wanted our social media to post up-to-date content that clearly communicated our company’s brand and values. We believe that our social media marketing strategy promotes our brand and content to increase brand awareness, drive a measurable amount of traffic, and generate leads.
