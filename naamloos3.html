  <h4 id="scrollspyHeading1">Problem</h4>
  <p>Gen Z and millennials are becoming more environmentally conscious and consider ethics when deciding what to buy, we solve 3 problems:<br><br>
There are many clothing brands that don't care about eco friendly products.<br>
There are many clothing brands that are not transparent about where they source their material and labor.<br>
There are many clothing brands that overwork their employees and under pay their staff to make more profit. <br><br>
</p>
  <h4 id="scrollspyHeading2">Customer Segments</h4>
  <p>WORN is directed to young people, mainly students or young professionals aged 16 till 30 based in Europe who care about sustainability. We believe that the inclusion of people from all races, ethnicities, sexual orientations and genders should be included to solidify our idea that the fight against environmental damage and fair business practices effects everyone. It requires a consistent effort from everyone, to achieve a future where the world is treated with care.<br><br>
</p>
  <h4 id="scrollspyHeading3">Unique value proposition</h4>
  <p>First, our message was to highlight the purchasing power customers have on the environment. Overall, we wanted to encourage buyers to consider the environment and question the production during their purchasing decisions.Our hope is customers will begin to evaluate other companies and whether or not they care about larger issues regarding our earth.<br>
So in the first place, we wanted to focus on several aspects, including eco-friendliness. However, we did realize that a brand does not make itself unique by focussing on this value. So how can we really differentiate ourselves in the market?<br>
We came to the conclusion that values like honesty and transparancy. Is something we want to highlight our brand with. We believe that eco-friendliness should not be something a brand should pride itself on. It should be a natural standard in every company. As well in ours, eco-friendliness is something that we care about and care for, but not focus the most on.<br><br>
So our final unique value proposition is …
<br><br>

</p>
  <h4 id="scrollspyHeading4">Solution</h4>
  <p> While buying one of the products of WORN, customers contribute to a better environment, a fairer fashion production and more honesty about the origin.</p>
  <h4 id="scrollspyHeading5">Unfair advantage</h4>
  <p>Our company is about honesty and transparency. We show where the fabric is coming from, and where it would’ve gone if we did not recycle it. We also show the worker who made the product. (for example, Anna from Bangladesh aged 43 got paid 200 taka for making this garment.) We show information of our workers and their wages, as well as the breakdown of the price of one garment.<br><br>To even upgrade our level of sustainability, we changed the country of labor to save on polluting by shipping. Bangladesh turned in to Portugal. In Portugal, the wages are still relatively low in comparison to other European countries and other clothing factories and shorter shipping distance is better for the environment. Still, the clothing pieces are made in a save and fair environment. <br><br>
So, our final advantage is that our company is about honesty and transparency. We show where the fabric is coming from, and where it would’ve gone if we did not recycle it. We show that in the label as well as on the website of our product. We also show the worker who made the sweater. (for example, Anna from Portugal aged 43 got paid 10 euros for making this garment.) We show information of our workers and their wages, as well as the breakdown of the price of one garment.<br><br>
  <h4 id="scrollspyHeading6">Revenue streams</h4>
  <p>...</p><br><br>
  <h4 id="scrollspyHeading7">Cost structure</h4>
  <p>...</p><br><br>
	<h4 id="scrollspyHeading8">Key matrics</h4>
  <p>WORN actively engages itself in the production of their products. The production of the garments takes place in a factory in Bangladesh. We want to manage that the workers there get paid fairly and that they have a safe working environment. <br> <br>
Additionally, all elements and fabrics used in our products must be recycled. The clothing will also be carefully washed and dried in the same facilities. The water would be removed carefully and disposed of properly to make sure no ink or dyes leak into the ocean.
<br><br>
To even upgrade our level of sustainability, we changed the country of labor to save on polluting by shipping. Bangladesh turned in to Portugal. In Portugal, the wages are still relatively low in comparison to other European countries and other clothing factories and shorter shipping distance is better for the environment. Still, the clothing pieces are made in a save and fair environment. <br><br>
To make the production of our sweaters more realistic, we decided upon a new composition of materials. At least 70% of the materials of which the product is recycled. The other 30% is all from bio cotton.
<br><br>

</p>
	<h4 id="scrollspyHeading9">Channels</h4>
  <p>The Channels our customers can reach us by, next to our website, is social media. Initially, we wanted to use Instagram, TikTok and YouTube to spread our marketing campaign. Already quite quickly we decided to remove YouTube from that list. Content posted on TikTok can be used on Instagram as well and perhaps vice versa. In the end, we did not manage to make it the other way around. TikToks we did post on Instagram, but unfortunately not the other way around. In these channels we try to link them to our website and webshop.</p><br>

  <h4 id="scrollspy2Heading1">Future planning</h4>
  <p>If we would continue with this project, there would be a lot of work for us to maintain. We would have to connect with a factory in Portugal and manage a lot of administration and documentation to make it work. The protocols of production in these Portuguese factories that would fit into our brand vision are expectedly not very common. The search for a fitting factory, and perhaps even the change of protocols and/or wages would be a large process that we would need to manage.<br><br>
In regards to the marketing plan, we would need to add more platforms to make ourselves appear more professional. <br><br>
</p>
  <h4 id="scrollspy2Heading2">Learning points</h4>
  <p>In the process of developing our brand, we learned how to distinguish ourselves from the market. We did this by, among others, not focussing on eco-friendliness, but only taking it into account. We realized that steps that may seem small, like maintaining an Instagram account as well as a TikTok account, are a lot more work than we initially expected. <br><br>
In such a small time, we were also a bit too optimistic about our marketing objective. We guessed way too high in the number of followers we expected to get. <br>

  <h4 id="scrollspy2Heading5">Testing process</h4>
  <p>In order to develop and provide you with a good concept, a good brand and a good website, we did several testings and interviews. We interviewed our possibile target audience in order to develop and provide you with a good concept, a good brand and a good website. In addition, we tested the design of our website in a paper prototype and the website as a whole.</p>  <a href="https://edubuas-my.sharepoint.com/personal/201462_buas_nl/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2F201462%5Fbuas%5Fnl%2FDocuments%2FPRJ4%20Recordings">Check this link to watch and listen to them!</a>
